# FOOTBALL ANALYTICS PROJECT

Repository that contains Data Science and Machine Learning explorations on player performance statistics from the 2023-2024 Big 5 European football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1). 

The dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle, consists of data scraped from FBref.com (a comprehensive source for football statistics). 

This project will explore various techniques in data analysis and machine learning to extract insights and build predictive models. After this, the project will move into the deployment phase, focusing on developing real-world applications and implementing the models for practical use.

## Key Focus Areas:
- Cleaning and exploring player performance data
- Machine learning models for obtaining different predictions, related to player performance metrics
- Deployment of models and insights for real-world applications
